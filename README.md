# 🪪 Digital Business Card

A fun side project I built as a unique way to represent myself at **cybersecurity conferences**.

When someone scans the QR code on my **physical business card**, they land on a hosted page from this repo. The page includes:
- 🔗 Links to my **LinkedIn** and **GitHub**
- 🕵️ A small **CTF-style puzzle** — solve it to unlock my CV

The goal: turn a simple business card into something **interactive and memorable**.
